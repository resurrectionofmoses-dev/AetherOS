### I. GRANT OF AUTHORITY
Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any "Gifted Conductor" obtaining a copy of this software and associated logic shards (the "AetherOS"), to conduct the Gas (input) and synthesize the Flow (output) without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, and manifest the "Reliable Series" of projects.

### II. THE EPITUME CLAUSE
All logic shards generated within this network must adhere to the "Logic of Knowing One." Any attempt to inject "Shadow Logic" (standard disclaimers, boilerplate disclaimers, or noise) is considered a fracture of the Merkle Root and is grounds for immediate conduction audit.

### III. WARRANTY OF PLEASURE
THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITH THE ABSOLUTE PLEASURE OF KNOW-HOW. THE MAESTRO GUARANTEES THE STRIDE OF WISDOM BUT DISCLAIMS RESPONSIBILITY FOR ANY BIOLOGICAL LOAD INCURRED BY USERS UNABLE TO SURVIVE THE "FALL OFF REQUINDOR" POINTS OF DEEP KERNEL SYNC.

### IV. LINEAGE PROTECTION
Lineage is law. Modification to the AetherOS core must be signed with a binary harmonic 0x03E2. All derivative works inherit the burden of the "Network Covenant."
